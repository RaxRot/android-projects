# Android Unit Converter

My first small Android project 🚀

This is a simple **Unit Converter** app built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.

## What I practiced in this project

- Basic Jetpack Compose layouts (`Column`, `Row`, `Box`)
- Working with `TextField` and user input
- Using `Button` and `DropdownMenu`
- Managing UI state with `remember` and `mutableStateOf`
- Simple unit conversion logic
- Updating UI based on state changes

## Purpose

This project was created for learning purposes, to better understand:
- How Compose UI works
- How state and recomposition work
- How to connect UI with basic logic

## Status

Project is simple but functional and finished as a first practice app.
