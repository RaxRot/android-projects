# Android Projects

This repository is a personal learning space for my Android development journey.

Here I collect small practice projects, experiments, and mini apps that I build
while learning **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.

Most projects are simple and created as part of:
- my own practice
- online courses
- tutorials and examples I study

The goal of this repository is to track my progress, practice regularly,
and better understand Android development step by step.

Work in progress 🚧
